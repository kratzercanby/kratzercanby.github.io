Markdown is a conversion process that takes simple text docuemnts and configuration files and turns them into a full static website directory. Github Pages can automatically generate a simple website based on Jekyll's markdown language. Let's look at a simple mapping of the default directories used by Jekyll, to get an idea of how markdown can make for an easy-to-update website.

This guide is based off the [Jekyll Step by Step Tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/), and is very helpful when getting started with markdown.

The basic file structure:
-| assets           (pretty self explanatory)
   --| css
   --| images
   --| js
-| _authors         (Bio's about each contributing author)
-| _data            (Navigation markdown file)
-| _includes        (html pages to include in other pages, like the navigation bar)
-| _layouts         (html layouts for types of pages)
-| _posts           (blog post markdown files)
-| _sass            (main css style, as scss)
-| _site            (where the command-line ruby tool generates the site)

Let's explore each folder a little bit more:
    * assets
    If you have javascript or images, they can go in the appropriate files. The CSCC files are actually generated by the Jekyll conversion, from the SCSS files (see the _sass section).
    
    * _authors
